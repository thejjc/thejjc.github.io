# Project: Solid Propulsion Component Design

The Problem
The goal of this project was to design a nozzle for a hybrid rocket motor that could withstand high temperatures and pressures while optimizing for thrust.

My Process & Tools
Analysis: I used MATLAB to run thermodynamic calculations and determine the optimal expansion ratio.

CAD: I modeled the nozzle in SolidWorks.

Simulation: I performed a thermal and stress analysis (FEA) using ANSYS to validate the design and material choice (graphite).

The Result
The final design was successfully 3D printed in [Material] for a cold-flow test. The simulation showed a 95% efficiency compared to the theoretical ideal.
